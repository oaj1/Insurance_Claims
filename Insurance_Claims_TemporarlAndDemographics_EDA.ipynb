    "### **Business Hours Analysis (9 AM - 5 PM)**\n",
    "- **Morning Rush (9-11 AM)**: Mixed pattern - Hour 9 has lowest fraud (9.3%), but Hour 11 has highest (40.0%)\n",
    "- **Lunch/Afternoon (12-3 PM)**: High fraud activity - Hours 14-15 show 34-35% fraud rates\n",

    "- **Late Night/Early Morning (12-6 AM)**: Variable rates ranging from 17.4% to 32.3%\n",

    "### **Red Flag Hours** ⚠️\n",
    "Claims occurring at **11 AM, 2 PM, 3 PM, and 6 PM** should receive enhanced scrutiny due to fraud rates exceeding 30%.\n",

    "- The **11 AM peak** suggests potential coordination with business operations or specific fraudulent schemes\n",
    "- The **5 PM dip** despite high business activity suggests genuine claims during end-of-workday incidents\n",
    "- **Evening hours (6-8 PM)** show elevated fraud, possibly targeting after-hours claim processing\n",

    "### **Risk Assessment Score**\n",
    "**Average fraud rate across all hours: 24.7%**\n",

    "- Hours with rates **25-35%**: High risk  \n",

    "### **Counter-Intuitive Findings**\n",
    "- **PhD holders** show the **highest fraud propensity** at 26.4%\n",
    "- **Masters degree holders** show the **lowest fraud rate** at 22.4%\n",
    "- Only **4% difference** between highest and lowest education levels (much smaller than occupation variance)\n",

    "Possible reasons for higher fraud among educated individuals:\n",
    "1. **Sophistication**: Advanced education enables more complex fraud schemes\n",
    "2. **Overconfidence**: Higher education may lead to belief they can outsmart detection systems\n",

    "4. **Knowledge Advantage**: Understanding of insurance processes and legal loopholes\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Risk Assessment Implications**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Low Variability**: \n",
    "- Education shows **much less predictive power** than occupation or time-of-day\n",
    "- **4% range** vs **20% range** for occupation\n",
    "- Should be considered a **secondary risk factor**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Investigation Strategy**:\n",
    "- **PhD/MD/JD claims**: Look for overly sophisticated explanations or medical/legal technicalities\n",
    "- **College graduates**: Standard enhanced verification\n",
    "- **Masters/High School**: Normal processing protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Fraud Prevention Recommendations**\n",
    "- **Education should NOT be primary risk factor** due to small variance\n",
    "- Focus resources on **occupation and temporal patterns** instead\n",
    "- Consider education as **fraud sophistication indicator** rather than likelihood predictor\n",
    "- Train investigators to recognize **credential-based manipulation tactics**\n",

    "**Average fraud rate across all education levels: 24.6%**\n",
